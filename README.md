# Solution

Solution Description:
I used the Rollup of the "Vite" tool, I used an architecture based on functional components in a declarative way, as well as a Context API, from this point onwards develop the solution in a simple and readable way, my intention was not to use many libraries help, try to be clean by applying my knowledge without "additives".

## How run the project

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
